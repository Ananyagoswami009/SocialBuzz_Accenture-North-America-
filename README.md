🚀 I'm excited to share the culmination of a challenging and incredibly insightful project: A comprehensive content analysis and strategic consulting engagement for Social Buzz, a dynamic and rapidly growing social media platform navigating the complexities of scaling towards an IPO.

Tasked as a Data Analyst at Accenture, I dove headfirst into Social Buzz's massive ecosystem of user-generated content. With over 100,000+ posts uploaded daily and reaching 36.5M yearly, understanding what content resonates and why was crucial for the brand's upcoming IPO launch. The scope included working with 7 complex datasets to mine meaningful insights and identify impactful action items for internal stakeholders. 
Our strategic goals as a team focused on how a vision could be achieved using these key areas: data analysis of big data practices, audits and performance metrics, and identifying the Top 5 most popular content categories, driving better business decisions for the upcoming IPO launch. 📈

Here’s a look into the journey:

🔍 Data Diving: Cleaning, modeling, and analyzing a sea of user interaction data, ultimately shaping raw data into actionable, strategic insights. We explored how various metrics inform engagement, from popular categories to the breakdown between video, photo, and audio mediums! 

📊 Category Exploration: Pinpointing Social Buzz's Top 5 performing content categories through detailed visualizations, including bar graphs and engagement data on specific types of social medium interaction. These strategic analytics reveal key insights. 

💬 Sentiment Mapping: Deeper dives revealed fascinating trends in engagement when content categories interacted with user types. This allowed us to identify clear paths where business goals could be realized! 

🎯 Strategic Recommendations: Key insights allowed us to deliver vital information around areas with strong performance, directly informing strategic decision-making to support the efficient IPO launch for our partner. 

Beyond the numbers, this project gave me hands-on experience in how a massive company on the brink of enormous scale can still be held accountable through proper data management to achieve strategic milestones. 🏆 My team and I discovered valuable insights to shape Social Buzz's future strategic direction, empowering this growing global company. 

This project solidified my skills in turning raw data into powerful outcomes—from content analysis to strategy-making and presentation delivery. 🎯📊 I’m incredibly proud of the experience and eager to dive into more data-driven journeys! 💡
